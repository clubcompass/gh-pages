# CLUB COMPASS

IDEA: The idea behind our project is for students at any insitution of education to be able to interact with all the clubs offered at their campus. Users will be able to login to the website, and view the clubs at their school. Not only does it allow them to view said clubs, but also join and interact with the presidents of each club. 

GOAL: The goal with Club Compass is  to create a more unified campus with clubs that are increasingly accessible to the public. As the project expands, we also hope to transition majority of student clubs digital for safety from covid.
