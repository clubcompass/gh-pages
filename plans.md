# CSA Plans

Mainly build the front end and backend application for the smart mirrior. I will also help with putting together the actual hardware of the project in order to get everything working. I will write the frontend of the application in React and deploy on vercel. The backend of the website will be written in node with graphql and will be hosted and served on vercel
